## What is ForThePeople.in?

ForThePeople.in aggregates publicly available Indian government data into clean, citizen-friendly dashboards — one for every district. Instead of navigating 50+ government portals, citizens get a single platform with real-time data on crop prices, dam levels, budget spending, school performance, infrastructure projects, and 25+ more modules.

**Currently live:** Karnataka (Mandya, Mysuru, Bengaluru Urban) |
Delhi (New Delhi) | Maharashtra (Mumbai) | West Bengal (Kolkata) | Tamil Nadu (Chennai) | Telangana (Hyderabad)
**Goal:** All 780+ districts across 28 states and 8 UTs.
