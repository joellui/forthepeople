## 2. LEGAL PROTECTION

```
LEGALLY SAFE BECAUSE:
1. RIGHT TO INFORMATION: Article 19(1)(a) of the Indian Constitution
2. OPEN DATA POLICY: data.gov.in operates under NDSAP — designed for public reuse
3. NO COPYRIGHTED CONTENT: Government data is public domain (Copyright Act §52(1)(q))
4. NO IMPERSONATION: Site clearly states it is NOT a government website

MANDATORY DISCLAIMERS (every page):
  EN: "ForThePeople.in is an independent citizen transparency initiative.
       This is NOT an official government website. All data is sourced from
       publicly available government portals under India's Open Data Policy (NDSAP)."
  Footer: "Data sourced under NDSAP | Built with ❤️ by Jayanth M B"

NEVER DO:
  ✗ Use government logos/emblems (Ashoka emblem, state seals)
  ✗ Claim to be an official government service
  ✗ Store personal citizen data (Aadhaar, PAN, etc.)
  ✗ Display full copyrighted news articles (headlines + links only)
  ✗ Charge money for accessing government data
  ✗ Scrape faster than 1 request per 2-3 seconds
```

---

## 4. TECH STACK

```
Framework:    Next.js 16.1.7 (App Router, TypeScript, src/ directory)
React:        19.2.3
CSS:          Tailwind CSS v4 (CSS-based config, tokens in globals.css @theme)
ORM:          Prisma 7.5.0 with prisma-client-js generator, output ../src/generated/prisma
DB adapter:   @prisma/adapter-pg (PrismaPg class — required for Prisma 7)
Database:     Neon PostgreSQL (production) / local Postgres via Prisma dev proxy (dev)
Cache:        @upstash/redis REST client (production Vercel — NOT ioredis)
              ioredis used ONLY in Railway scraper container
State:        @tanstack/react-query v5 + zustand v5
Charts:       recharts v3 (lazy loaded)
Maps:         react-simple-maps + topojson-client (India SVG map — FINAL, do not change)
              TalukMap.tsx uses react-simple-maps for taluk drill-down
Icons:        lucide-react
i18n:         next-intl v4
Payments:     razorpay SDK + Razorpay Live checkout
Email:        resend v6 (2FA recovery emails)
2FA:          otpauth + qrcode (Google Authenticator TOTP)
Scraping:     cheerio + puppeteer + node-cron (scraper container)
AI providers: @anthropic-ai/sdk + @google/generative-ai
Encryption:   AES-256-CBC (Node.js crypto) via src/lib/encryption.ts
Date:         date-fns v4
```

### VERIFIED vs SPECULATIVE

```
VERIFIED (code confirmed):
  - Next.js 16.1.7, React 19, Tailwind v4 CSS-based config
  - Prisma 7.5.0 with @prisma/adapter-pg
  - @upstash/redis (NOT ioredis) on Vercel serverless
  - react-simple-maps for India map + taluk map
  - recharts (lazy loaded with next/dynamic)
  - Razorpay Live keys configured
  - next-intl v4 for English + Kannada
  - @anthropic-ai/sdk for Claude Opus
  - @google/generative-ai for Gemini
  - AES-256-CBC encryption for stored API keys + TOTP secrets

SPECULATIVE (assumed from dependencies, not fully verified):
  - zustand v5 store usage in specific components
  - puppeteer usage in scraper jobs
  - bullmq (listed as dep but may be unused currently)
```

### Critical Library Notes
- `@upstash/redis` (NOT ioredis) on Vercel — ioredis requires persistent TCP, crashes serverless
- `ioredis` is used ONLY in the scraper scheduler running on Railway containers
- `recharts` Tooltip `formatter` must NOT type-param as `(v: number)` — use `(v)` + `Number(v)` cast
- `react-simple-maps` is FRAGILE — see Section 7 for fix history. Never rewrite map components.
- Budget values stored in Rupees (NOT Crores) — display always divides by 1e7 to show Crores

## 5. DISTRICT HIERARCHY & ROUTING

```
LEVEL 0: Country     → forthepeople.in/
LEVEL 1: State       → /en/karnataka/
LEVEL 2: District    → /en/karnataka/mandya/
LEVEL 3: Taluk/Block → /en/karnataka/mandya/srirangapatna/ (future)
LEVEL 4: Village     → /en/karnataka/mandya/srirangapatna/ganjam/ (future)

ROUTE STRUCTURE:
  /[locale]/[state]/[district]/[module]/page.tsx
  Locale: "en" | "kn" (next-intl)
  State: slug (e.g., "karnataka")
  District: slug (e.g., "mandya", "mysuru", "bengaluru-urban")
  Module: one of 30 modules (see Section 6)

LOCK BEHAVIOR:
  Active district:  Full data, clickable
  Locked district:  Grayed out, "Coming Soon"

8 ACTIVE PILOT DISTRICTS (6 states):
  Mandya (ಮಂಡ್ಯ)          — "Sugar Capital of Karnataka"
  Mysuru (ಮೈಸೂರು)         — "City of Palaces"
  Bengaluru Urban (ಬೆಂಗಳೂರು) — "Silicon Valley of India"
  New Delhi (नई दिल्ली)    — "Seat of India's Government"
  Mumbai (मुंबई)           — "Financial Capital of India"
  Kolkata (কলকাতা)         — "City of Joy"
  Chennai (சென்னை)         — "Gateway to South India"
  Hyderabad (హైదరాబాద్)    — "City of Pearls" [Added 2026-04-10]

MANDYA TALUKS (7):
  1. Mandya        — "Sugar Capital of Karnataka"
  2. Maddur        — "Gateway to Old Mysore"
  3. Malavalli     — "Land of Temples & Tanks"
  4. Srirangapatna — "Tipu Sultan's Island Fortress"
  5. Nagamangala   — "Heart of the Deccan Plateau"
  6. K R Pete      — "Jewel of the Kaveri Basin"
  7. Pandavapura   — "Where the Pandavas Rested"
```

### Sitemap & SEO
- `sitemap.ts` uses `INDIA_STATES` (NOT `INDIA_HIERARCHY`) from districts.ts
- Only active districts are included (filter: `active: true`)
- All static page canonicals → /en/ variants
- hreflang: en, kn, x-default on homepage

Use:    /api/data/overview      (correct)
Use:    /api/data/weather       (correct)
Use:    /api/data/police        (correct)
Use:    /api/data/news          (correct)
Use:    /api/data/population    (correct)
Use:    /api/data/exams         (correct — new, Phase 5)
```

### Navigation
- Desktop: Sidebar with pinned modules + "Show all" toggle + emoji per module
- Mobile: Left hamburger → slide-in drawer (all 30 modules in 6 categories)
- Mobile bottom: MobileTabNav tab strip
- Breadcrumb: overflow:visible on desktop nav (not hidden — or dropdowns get clipped)
- Mobile breadcrumb strip: sticky top:56px
- Sidebar overflow:visible required (never set to hidden/overflow-x-hidden on nav)

## 7. INTERACTIVE MAP (FRAGILE)

### History of Map Implementation (3 attempts)
```
Attempt 1: D3.js + custom SVG — abandoned (complex, GeoJSON winding bugs, world-spanning fills)
Attempt 2: Leaflet.js + react-leaflet — abandoned (SSR issues, complex setup for India map)
Attempt 3: react-simple-maps — FINAL (works, simpler API, easier India state highlighting)
```

### Current Implementation
- Library: `react-simple-maps` + `topojson-client`
- India SVG map: portrait viewBox 800×900, scale=900, center=[82.5,23]
  - J&K at approximately y=175, south tip at approximately y=696 — fits all of India
- GeoJSON: exterior rings MUST be CW (clockwise winding)
  - Despite RFC7946 claiming CCW, d3-geo in practice needs CW for correct exterior rings
  - Zero-area rings (< 1e-10 by shoelace area) cause world-spanning fills — always remove them
- MapErrorBoundary component wraps all map renders
- Cache bust: GeoJSON served with `?v=4` query
- GeoJSON Cache-Control: 24h in response headers
- Taluk map: `TalukMap.tsx` + `public/geo/mandya-taluks.json` (approximate polygons)

### Rules (CRITICAL — never violate)
```
NEVER modify map components unless you have verified the fix in the browser.
NEVER change viewBox dimensions without testing all 36 states render correctly.
Use Playwright to inspect SVG DOM when debugging — check path `d` attribute for extreme
  coords (x > 900 or x < -100 means world-spanning bug).
Use getBoundingClientRect per path to debug individual state renders.
```

## 8. DATABASE SCHEMA (45+ PRISMA MODELS)

### Prisma 7 Configuration
```
Generator:  provider = "prisma-client-js", output = "../src/generated/prisma"
Imports:    from '@/generated/prisma'
Config:     prisma.config.ts at project root
            import "dotenv/config"
            defineConfig({ datasource: { url: process.env.DATABASE_URL! } })
Adapter:    new PrismaPg({ connectionString }) from @prisma/adapter-pg
            PrismaPg v7 takes pg.PoolConfig as first arg: new PrismaPg({ connectionString })
CRITICAL:   NO `url` field in datasource block of schema.prisma (Prisma 7 uses config file)
```

## 9. 4 AI ENGINES

All AI calls go through `src/lib/ai-provider.ts` → `callAI()` and `callAIJSON()` unified gateway.
NEVER call Anthropic or Gemini APIs directly — always use callAI().

### ZERO-CREDIT RULE (CRITICAL — Backend Only)
Public API routes (`/api/ai/insight`, `/api/ai/citizen-tips`) are **READ-ONLY**.
They serve ONLY from Redis cache or DB — never call `callAI()` on public GET requests.
Returning null/empty instead of generating live AI prevents unauthorized billing.
- Cron routes (`/api/cron/generate-insights`) are protected by `x-cron-secret: CRON_SECRET`
- Admin routes require `ftp_admin_v1` cookie
- Direct AI key access is NEVER exposed to the client

### Provider Architecture
```
1. OpusCode.pro (Anthropic proxy)
   activeProvider = "anthropic", anthropicSource = "opuscode"
   Key stored: provider = "anthropic" in AdminAPIKey
   Base URL: process.env.ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL || settings.anthropicBaseUrl
   Auto-detection: if ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL contains "opuscode" → forces anthropicSource=opuscode

2. Official Anthropic
   activeProvider = "anthropic", anthropicSource = "official"
   Key stored: provider = "anthropic_official" in AdminAPIKey
   Base URL: "https://api.anthropic.com"

3. Google Gemini
   activeProvider = "gemini"
   Key stored: provider = "gemini" in AdminAPIKey
   Default model: gemini-2.5-flash
```

### Key Resolution Priority
1. DB-stored encrypted key (AdminAPIKey where provider = keyName, isActive = true)
2. Env var fallback: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or GEMINI_API_KEY
3. Returns null → AI call fails gracefully

### Base URL Priority (CRITICAL)
```typescript
process.env.ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL || settings.anthropicBaseUrl || "https://api.anthropic.com"
// Env var MUST take priority over DB default — always
```

### Models
```
Gemini:     gemini-2.5-flash (default), gemini-2.0-flash, gemini-1.5-pro
Anthropic:  claude-opus-4-6 (default), claude-sonnet-4-6, claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
```

### Response Parsing (CRITICAL)
```typescript
// CORRECT: find the text block — do NOT assume content[0] is text
const textBlock = response.content.find(b => b.type === 'text');
// Extended thinking: maxTokens MUST be >= 2048
// Extended thinking may add thinking blocks BEFORE the text block — always use .find()
```

### Engine 1: News Intelligence Pipeline
- Location: `src/scraper/jobs/news.ts` → `src/scraper/jobs/ai-analyzer.ts`
- Flow: RSS scraping → Gemini/Opus classification → targetModule + extractedData stored in NewsItem
- Schedule: Every 1 hour (news), analysis in ai-analyzer.ts
- Stores results as AIInsight records, then queues for admin review

### Engine 2: News Action Engine
- Location: `src/lib/news-action-engine.ts`
- Functions: `classifyArticleWithAI()` extracts structured data from news
- `executeNewsAction()` auto-executes DB mutations at confidence > 0.85
- Queues for human review at confidence 0.60–0.85
- Skips (discards) at confidence < 0.60
- Stores pending actions in `NewsActionQueue` model

### Engine 3: Pre-computed AI Module Insights
- Location: `src/lib/insight-generator.ts`
- Generates insights for 30 modules × all active districts
- Stored in `AIModuleInsight` with TTL/expiry field
- Generated every 2 hours by Vercel cron (`/api/cron/generate-insights`)
- On request: Redis → DB (check expiry) → generate fresh if expired
- Shown as `AIInsightCard` on 11 module pages
- Footer shows: "Source-verified by Claude/Gemini AI" with actual provider+model

### Engine 4: Opus Fact Checker
- Location: `src/lib/fact-checker.ts`
- Runs 25+ module-level checks
- Born-in-district rule: famous personalities must be born in the specific district
- Saves results to `FactCheckStatus` table with per-module breakdown
- Admin-accessible via Dashboard tab → FactChecker component
- POST `/api/admin/fact-check` — runs checks, returns issuesFound, staleItems, duplicates

## 10. DISTRICT HEALTH SCORE

### Algorithm (`src/lib/health-score.ts`)
```
10 Categories with BASE weights (total = 100%):
  governance       15%  — infrastructure + budget utilization + leadership
  education        12%  — school results + student-teacher ratio + coverage
  health           12%  — hospital beds + doctor ratio + coverage
  infrastructure   12%  — project completion + road density
  waterSanitation  10%  — dam levels + JJM coverage + water supply
  economy          10%  — crop prices + industries + employment
  safety           10%  — crime rate + police coverage
  agriculture       8%  — crop diversity + soil health + advisory
  digitalAccess     5%  — internet/mobile penetration
  citizenWelfare    6%  — scheme enrollment + RTI usage

District-type aware weights (getAdjustedWeights):
  metro   (pop>5M)       — boosts infrastructure+digitalAccess, reduces agriculture
  urban   (pop>1M)       — uses base weights
  semi-urban (density>500) — uses base weights
  rural   (default)      — boosts agriculture+waterSanitation, reduces infrastructure+digitalAccess

Precision:
  Category scores: 1 decimal (e.g. 72.4)
  Overall score:   2 decimal (e.g. 68.37)

Grade thresholds:
  A+ = score >= 90  |  A = score >= 80  |  B+ = score >= 70
  B  = score >= 60  |  C+ = score >= 50 |  C  = score >= 40
  D  = score >= 30  |  F  = score < 30

Breakdown includes: districtType, trendChange, trendDetails (per-category change >0.5 points)

Pre-computed: Weekly by cron, stored in DistrictHealthScore table.
Shown on: Homepage district cards, District overview page header.
```

### Current Pilot Scores
```
Mandya:          59.0 / 100  (C+)
Mysuru:          52.8 / 100  (C+)
Bengaluru Urban: 55.4 / 100  (C+)
Delhi (New Delhi): [pending — run health score calculation after testing]
```

## 11. FEATURE VOTING

### Architecture
- 23 feature requests seeded via `prisma/seed-features.ts`
- Models: `FeatureRequest` (title, description, votes, status, category) + `FeatureVote`
- Fingerprint: SHA-256(IP + User-Agent).slice(0, 32) — anonymous but unique per device
- Anti-double-vote: `@@unique([featureId, fingerprint])` constraint on FeatureVote
- Vote transaction: atomic `create` vote + `increment` count (prevents race condition)
- Page: `src/app/[locale]/features/page.tsx`

### Feature Categories
- data_modules, scrapers, ui_ux, community, technical, ai_features

### Status Values
- pending → planned → shipped

---

## 12. HOMEPAGE

---

## 13. SCRAPER ARCHITECTURE

### Infrastructure
```
Container: Railway.app (Dockerfile.scraper) — runs 24/7 always-on
Scheduler: src/scraper/scheduler.ts — node-cron
Jobs dir:  src/scraper/jobs/*.ts (21 scrapers)
Logger:    src/scraper/logger.ts → ScraperLog DB table
Redis:     ioredis (NOT @upstash/redis) for Railway container
Districts: getActiveDistricts() queries prisma.district.findMany({ where: { active: true } })
           All scrapers are DB-driven — no hardcoded district arrays
```

### Dockerfile.scraper
```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine
WORKDIR /app
RUN apk add --no-cache python3 make g++
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install --legacy-peer-deps   # npm ci FAILS due to peer dep conflicts
COPY . .
RUN npx prisma generate
ENV NODE_ENV=production
CMD ["npx", "tsx", "src/scraper/scheduler.ts"]
```

### Scraper Schedule
```
Every 5 min:   weather.ts       — OpenWeatherMap API (uses ctx.districtName, OWM_CITY_OVERRIDE)
Every 15 min:  crops.ts         — AGMARKNET via DATA_GOV_API_KEY (AGMARKNET_DISTRICT_OVERRIDE)
               power.ts         — BESCOM power outages
Every 30 min:  dams.ts          — KRS dam levels
Every 1 h:     news.ts          — RSS feeds (3 queries per district, 50 item limit, URL dedup)
Every 2 h:     alerts.ts        — Local alerts aggregation
               insights.ts      — Pre-compute AI module insights (generate-insights cron)
Every 6 h:     police.ts        — Police data
Every 12 h:    infrastructure.ts — Project status
               exams.ts          — Govt exam notifications + staffing (Phase 5, March 2026)
Daily:         rti.ts           — RTI statistics
               courts.ts        — Court pendency
               mgnrega.ts       — MGNREGA NREGS portal
Weekly:        jjm.ts           — Jal Jeevan Mission
               housing.ts       — PMAY housing
               schools.ts       — UDISE school data
Monthly:       finance.ts       — Budget/revenue
               transport.ts     — KSRTC/railway schedules
               schemes.ts       — Central/state schemes
               soil.ts          — Soil health cards (KVK)
               elections.ts     — Election commission data
               ai-analyzer.ts   — AI news intelligence pipeline + NewsAction execution
```

### JobContext (scraper/types.ts)
```typescript
interface JobContext {
  districtId: string;
  districtSlug: string;
  districtName: string;  // Added for scalability — used by weather, crops
  stateName: string;     // Added for scalability — used by crops AGMARKNET
  stateSlug: string;
}
```

### Vercel Cron Jobs (in vercel.json)
```
/api/cron/scrape-news       — daily 6AM UTC    (news scrape + dedup + expire stale)
/api/cron/scrape-crops      — daily 3:30AM UTC (9AM IST — AGMARKNET crop prices all active districts)
/api/cron/generate-insights — every 2h         (pre-compute AI insights 30 modules × all districts)
```
Authentication: `Authorization: Bearer CRON_SECRET` header.
CRITICAL: CRON_SECRET must ONLY be read from the Authorization header — never from query params
(query params appear in server logs and browser history — security vulnerability).

---

## 14. SCRAPING SOURCES

- Auto-expire LocalAlert records > 14 days old (active: false)
- AI news intelligence: runs post-news-scrape to classify and generate insights

---

## 15. API DESIGN

### Module Data API
```
GET /api/data/[module]?district=mandya&state=karnataka

Caching strategy:
  Layer 1: @upstash/redis (Redis cache) with per-module TTL
  Layer 2: Prisma query to Neon PostgreSQL

Module TTLs (from src/lib/cache.ts):
  weather:      5 minutes
  crops:        15 minutes
  water/dams:   30 minutes
  news:         60 minutes
  All others:   5 minutes default

Response includes:
  data: { ...moduleData }
  meta: { lastUpdated: timestamp, source: string }
```

### Cache Keys
```typescript
// Format: ftp:{module}:{districtSlug}
cacheKey('weather', 'mandya') → "ftp:weather:mandya"
```

### ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)
- District page: `export const revalidate = 300` (5 minutes)
- GeoJSON files: Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400 (24 hours)

## 16. ADMIN PANEL

URL: `forthepeople.in/en/admin`

### 6 Tabs
```
1. Dashboard   — Overview stats, sync tools, FactChecker, DataVerifier, StaleDataManager
2. AI Settings — 3-provider cards (OpusCode.pro, Official Anthropic, Gemini), model select,
                 fallback toggle, advanced (maxTokens, temperature), test connection

4. Review      — AI Insight review queue (approve/reject generated insights)
5. Feedback    — All user feedback submissions with status management
6. Supporters  — Contributions table with Razorpay sync button + router.refresh() after sync
```

### AI Settings Page (`/admin/ai-settings`)
```
3 provider cards with single-select "Activate" button
Active card: colored border + "ACTIVE" badge
Expandable API key input per card (hidden by default)

Provider mapping:
  OpusCode.pro     → activeProvider="anthropic", anthropicSource="opuscode", key="anthropic"
  Official Anthropic → activeProvider="anthropic", anthropicSource="official", key="anthropic_official"
  Google Gemini    → activeProvider="gemini", key="gemini"

API routes: GET/PUT /api/admin/ai-settings, POST/DELETE /api/admin/api-keys
```

### Fact Checker (`FactChecker.tsx`)
```
Runs: POST /api/admin/fact-check
Modules: leadership, budget, infrastructure, demographics, courts, news/alerts, all
Returns: totalItems, issuesFound, staleItems, duplicates, per-module results
Stored: FactCheckStatus table with durationMs, aiProvider, aiModel
GET returns last 20 checks
District selector: cascading State→District dropdown from /api/admin/districts
```

### Data Verifier
```
POST /api/admin/verify-data — AI QA of a specific module
Returns: issues[], suggestions[], confidence(0-100), status(ok/warning/error)
Graceful error: returns status:"error" NOT a 500 on AI failure
```

### Stale Data Management
```
GET  /api/admin/expire-stale    — preview stale alerts (shows count + oldest)
POST /api/admin/expire-stale    — expire alerts older than N days
POST /api/admin/deduplicate-news — dedup by normalized title prefix (keep newest)
POST /api/admin/cleanup-news    — comprehensive cleanup (x-admin-password header):
   1. Delete NewsItems older than 7 days
   2. Delete future-dated NewsItems (RSS parse errors)
   3. Delete duplicate articles by title prefix (keeps oldest per district+prefix)
   4. Delete auto-generated LocalAlerts older than 7 days
   5. Clear NewsActionQueue (pending + skipped items)
   6. Delete stale AIInsight records (module=alerts or createdAt >7 days)

GET /api/data/freshness?district=<slug> — traffic-light data freshness per module:
   Returns: { status: "green"|"amber"|"red"|"unknown", age, lastUpdated } per module
   Expected intervals: weather=10min, dam=60min, news/alerts/insights=120min, crops=1440min
```

### News Pipeline Quality Gates
```
isArticleFresh(): Reject if >3 days old, future-dated, or year < current-1
  - Google News RSS returns by relevance not recency; old articles silently reappear

isTitleDuplicate(): Normalize → first 5 words (len>3) → in-memory Set + DB lookup
  - Google News uses different redirect URLs for the same article (URL dedup alone insufficient)

classifyArticleWithAI(publishedAt): Injects article age into AI prompt
  - CRITICAL DATE RULE: events >2 days old → module=news, confidence ≤ 0.4, no alerts
```

---

## 17. SECURITY

### Admin Authentication
```
Cookie: ftp_admin_v1 = "ok" (HttpOnly, set by /admin login)
Password: ADMIN_PASSWORD env var (verified using timingSafeEqual — constant-time compare)
All admin API routes check isAuthed() which reads cookie
Alternative: x-admin-secret header (for direct API calls)
```

### 2FA (Google Authenticator TOTP)
```
Library: otpauth + qrcode
Secret: stored AES-256-CBC encrypted in AdminAuth.totpSecret
Setup: /api/admin/2fa/setup → scan QR → /api/admin/2fa/verify
Disable: /api/admin/2fa/disable
Recovery: /api/admin/2fa/recover → Resend email → /api/admin/2fa/recover/verify
Backup codes: 8 codes, stored encrypted JSON in AdminAuth.backupCodes
Rate limiting: failedAttempts counter, lockedUntil timestamp in AdminAuth
```

### Encryption (`src/lib/encryption.ts`)
```
Algorithm: AES-256-CBC
Key: ENCRYPTION_SECRET env var (32+ char random string)
Used for: AdminAPIKey.encryptedKey, AdminAuth.totpSecret, AdminAuth.backupCodes
Format: encrypt(plaintext) → "iv:ciphertext" (base64 encoded)
```

### Payment Security
```
Razorpay signature: HMAC-SHA256(orderId + "|" + paymentId, RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET)
Comparison: timingSafeEqual (prevents timing attacks)
Webhook: same HMAC-SHA256 with RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET
```

### NEXT_PUBLIC Rules
```
ONLY these two keys may be NEXT_PUBLIC:
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL         — https://forthepeople.in
  NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID  — Razorpay key ID (needed for client-side checkout)
No other secrets in NEXT_PUBLIC — they ship to the browser
```

### Cron Authentication
```
Header: Authorization: Bearer CRON_SECRET
Env var: CRON_SECRET (set in Vercel dashboard)
Applies to: /api/cron/scrape-news, /api/cron/scrape-crops, /api/cron/generate-insights, /api/cron/news-intelligence
```
SECURITY RULE: Read CRON_SECRET from Authorization header ONLY.
Never accept it as a URL query param — URL params appear in server access logs and browser history.

### Rate Limiting
```
Library: src/lib/rate-limit.ts (Upstash Redis incr + expire)
Usage: await rateLimit(identifier, limit=60, window=60)
Fallback: if Redis unavailable, gracefully allows all requests (no crash)
Apply to: public API routes that could be abused
```

## 17B. CREATOR WATERMARKING

Deep watermarking to prove original authorship. Removing all marks requires touching 100+ files.

### Layers
```
1. Source code headers (219 source files):
   /**
    * ForThePeople.in — Your District. Your Data. Your Right.
    * © 2026 Jayanth M B. MIT License with Attribution.
    * https://github.com/jayanthmb14/forthepeople
    */

2. HTML <head> meta tags (src/app/layout.tsx metadata.other):
   original-author, project-inception, x-created-by, x-project-id, x-repository

3. JSON-LD WebApplication schema (layout.tsx):
   "@type": "WebApplication", "author": { "name": "Jayanth M B" }, "dateCreated": "2026-03-17"

4. HTTP Response headers (src/middleware.ts — every response):
   X-Powered-By: ForThePeople.in
   X-Creator: Jayanth M B
   X-Project-ID: FTP-JMB-2026-IN
   X-License: MIT with Attribution — github.com/jayanthmb14/forthepeople

5. package.json: author, repository, homepage, keywords, description

6. LICENSE file: MIT with Attribution (requires keeping original creator attribution)

7. public/humans.txt: Creator attribution for humans.txt standard

8. watermark.ts: CREATOR constant exported with projectId, inception date
```

### Watermark Utility (`src/lib/watermark.ts`)
```typescript
import { CREATOR, addWatermarkHeaders, getWatermarkMeta } from '@/lib/watermark';
// CREATOR.projectId = "FTP-JMB-2026-IN"
// CREATOR.inception = "2026-03-17"
// CREATOR.repository = "github.com/jayanthmb14/forthepeople"
```

### GitHub Repo
```
URL:     https://github.com/jayanthmb14/forthepeople (public after clean push)
History: Fresh single commit (no leaked secrets in history)
License: MIT with Attribution — requires creator credit in any fork
```

---

## 18. PERFORMANCE

### Lazy Loading
```typescript
// All heavy components use next/dynamic with ssr:false
const MapComponent = dynamic(() => import('./MapComponent'), { ssr: false });
const RechartChart = dynamic(() => import('./ChartComponent'), { ssr: false });
```

### Redis Caching Strategy
```
@upstash/redis REST client (not TCP — works in Vercel serverless)
TTLs:
  weather:   300s (5 min)
  crops:     900s (15 min)
  dams:      1800s (30 min)
  news:      3600s (1 h)
  default:   300s (5 min)
  ai insights: 21600s (6 h)
```

### Static & ISR
```
Homepage: fully static (getStaticProps equivalent)
District page: ISR revalidate=300 (5 minutes)
Module pages: ISR revalidate=300
GeoJSON: static files with Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400 (24h)
Sitemap: auto-generated from active districts (DB-driven)
```

### Mobile Performance
- Target: works on ₹8000 Android phones on 4G
- Min tap target: 44×44px (enforced in mobile sidebar and dropdowns)

  Supporter      (₹499)  — one-time
  District Champion (₹1999) — one-time
  State Patron   (₹4999) — one-time

Payment Flow:
  1. POST /api/payment/create-order → creates Razorpay order, returns orderId
  2. Razorpay checkout modal on frontend (uses NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID)
  3. POST /api/payment/verify → HMAC-SHA256 sig verify, save to Contribution table
  4. POST /api/webhooks/razorpay → webhook backup (timingSafeEqual sig verify)
  5. GET  /api/payment/contributors → public contributor wall (isPublic=true only)

Admin Sync:
  POST /api/admin/sync-razorpay → fetch last 100 captured payments from Razorpay API
    - Skip captured=false payments
    - Dedup by paymentId
    - Upsert into Supporter table
    - After sync: SyncButton calls router.refresh() to update Server Component stats

Contributor Wall: shown on /support + compact version on homepage

## 21. DEPLOYMENT

### Frontend — Vercel (CURRENT CORRECT METHOD)
```bash
git push origin main   # AUTO-DEPLOYS via GitHub integration
# NEVER use: npx vercel --prod (causes Vercel scope/account issues)
```
- Vercel account: zurvoapp Pro (scope: zurvoapps-projects)
- GitHub: jayanthmb14/forthepeople (private)
- Domain: forthepeople.in (Hostinger DNS → Vercel)
- Git email MUST be jayanthmbj@gmail.com:
  git config user.email "jayanthmbj@gmail.com"

### Scraper — Railway
```
Service: Docker container from Dockerfile.scraper
Runs: 24/7 always-on container
Connects: directly to Neon PostgreSQL
Auto-restarts on crash
Env vars: set in Railway dashboard
```

### Local Dev
```bash
# Terminal 1 — Start Prisma dev proxy (KEEP RUNNING)
cd forthepeople && npx prisma dev

# Terminal 2 — Start Next.js
npm run dev

# Access: http://localhost:3000/en/karnataka/mandya
```
- Prisma proxy: port 51213 (prisma+postgres://)
- Actual Postgres: port 51214 (direct postgresql://)
- DATABASE_URL must use template1 db with port 51214 locally

### Database Commands
```bash
npx prisma db push              # Apply schema changes (no migration files)
npx prisma generate             # Regenerate Prisma client
npx tsx prisma/seed.ts          # Re-seed Mandya data
npx tsx prisma/seed-hierarchy.ts  # Seed State→District→Taluk hierarchy
npx tsx prisma/seed-features.ts   # Seed 23 feature requests

# Force reset (DANGEROUS):
PRISMA_USER_CONSENT_FOR_DANGEROUS_AI_ACTION="yes" npx prisma db push --force-reset
```

### Cron Configuration (vercel.json)
```json
{
  "crons": [
    { "path": "/api/cron/scrape-news",       "schedule": "0 6 * * *"   },
    { "path": "/api/cron/scrape-crops",      "schedule": "30 3 * * *"  },
    { "path": "/api/cron/generate-insights", "schedule": "0 */2 * * *" }
  ]
}
```

## 22. SCALING — HOW TO ADD A NEW DISTRICT

### Step-by-Step Checklist

#### Step 1: Add to Hierarchy Seeder
```bash
# Edit prisma/seed-hierarchy.ts — add new State (if new) + District + Taluks
# Run against production Neon DB:
npx tsx prisma/seed-hierarchy.ts
```

#### Step 2: Add to Static Constants
```typescript
// Edit src/lib/constants/districts.ts
// Add to INDIA_STATES array (used for static routing + compare page)
// District becomes available in all DB-driven APIs automatically
```

#### Step 3: Handle Name Overrides (if needed)
```typescript
// src/scraper/jobs/weather.ts — add to OWM_CITY_OVERRIDE if OpenWeatherMap
// uses a different name than the district slug
OWM_CITY_OVERRIDE['new-district-slug'] = 'City Name For OWM';

// src/scraper/jobs/crops.ts — add to AGMARKNET_DISTRICT_OVERRIDE if needed
AGMARKNET_DISTRICT_OVERRIDE['new-district-slug'] = 'AGMARKNET Name';
```

#### Step 4: Seed Initial Data
```bash
# Create a seed file: prisma/seed-newdistrict.ts
# Seed: leadership, budget, demographics, infrastructure projects
npx tsx prisma/seed-newdistrict.ts
```

#### Step 5: Activate the District
```sql
-- In Neon DB console or via prisma:
UPDATE "District" SET active = true WHERE slug = 'new-district-slug';
```

#### Step 6: Automatic — Nothing Else Needed
After `active: true`, the following work automatically:
- All 30 module API routes (DB-driven by districtSlug)
- Scraper jobs (queries active districts from DB)
- Admin dropdowns (FactChecker, VerifySection)
- Homepage preview cards
- Sitemap generation
- District health score calculation
- AI insight generation (next cron run)
- News intelligence pipeline

### Future Schema Enhancements (tracked in SCALING-CHECKLIST.md)
```
[ ] Add owmCityName field to District model (replace OWM_CITY_OVERRIDE dict)
[ ] Add agmarknetName field to District model (replace AGMARKNET_DISTRICT_OVERRIDE dict)
[ ] Full State→District cascading in admin panel (currently flat district list)
[ ] TalukSelector component on district overview page
```

### How to Add a New State
1. Add State + Districts + Taluks to `prisma/seed-hierarchy.ts` → run it
2. Add to `src/lib/constants/districts.ts` INDIA_STATES array
3. Add any regional font to `src/app/globals.css` @import (Noto Sans for the language)
4. Update OWM_CITY_OVERRIDE and AGMARKNET_DISTRICT_OVERRIDE as needed
5. Activate districts → everything else is automatic

---

## 23. KNOWN CONSTRAINTS

### Vercel Limits
```
Function timeout: 5 minutes max (AI calls must complete within this)
Hobby plan crons: 1 cron job per day (we use Pro which allows multiple)
Background jobs: NOT supported — use Railway for always-on scrapers
Serverless: no persistent TCP connections → must use @upstash/redis REST (not ioredis)
```

### Railway
```
Scraper container: always-on Docker container (node-cron scheduler)
Not Vercel-compatible: uses ioredis which needs persistent TCP
Railway free tier: may sleep after inactivity — use paid tier for production
```

### Neon PostgreSQL
```
Free tier: 0.5GB storage limit
Connection pooling: Neon handles pooling; use adapter-pg, not direct pool management
Scale tier: needed once >3 active districts with real-time scraping
```

### Upstash Redis
```
Free tier: 10,000 requests/day limit
Production: needs paid tier once daily cron runs × active districts exceed limit
REST API only (no TCP): compatible with Vercel serverless
```

### AI Calls
```
OpusCode proxy: higher rate limits than official Anthropic API
Extended thinking: maxTokens MUST be >= 2048 for thinking to work
Response parsing: ALWAYS use content.find(b => b.type === 'text') — never content[0]
Gemini free tier: sufficient for current load (3 districts)
Cost scales: linearly with active districts × modules × cron frequency
```

## 25. COST ANALYSIS

```
Vercel Pro (zurvoapp):    ~$20/month (includes cron + preview deployments)
Neon PostgreSQL:          Free tier (0.5GB) — sufficient for 3 districts
                          Scale tier ~$20/month if >10 districts
Upstash Redis:            Free tier (10K req/day) — upgrade to $10/month at scale
Railway (scraper):        ~$5/month (always-on container, minimal CPU)
Razorpay:                 2% per transaction (no monthly fee)
Resend:                   Free (100 emails/day)
Gemini API:               Free tier sufficient for current load
Anthropic/OpusCode:       ~$10-20/month (Claude Opus calls for insights + fact-check)
Domain (forthepeople.in): ~₹800/year (~₹67/month)

CURRENT TOTAL:            ~₹2,500-3,500/month (~₹108/district/month for 3 districts)
AT SCALE (780 districts): ~₹108/district/year if infra scales linearly
                          Realistically ~₹5,000/month for 100 districts

---

## 27. ANTI-PATTERNS (Things That Don't Work And Why)

### Libraries to Never Use on Vercel
```
ioredis        — Requires persistent TCP connection. Crashes Vercel serverless functions.
                 Use @upstash/redis (REST-based) instead.
bullmq         — Also requires ioredis. Do not use in Next.js API routes.
node-cron      — Does not work in Vercel serverless. Use Vercel cron + /api/cron/ routes.
puppeteer      — Too heavy for Vercel (memory limit). Use only in Railway scraper container.
```

### Map Anti-Patterns
```
Never: Change react-simple-maps viewBox without testing all 36 states
Never: Use CCW winding for GeoJSON exterior rings (d3-geo needs CW despite RFC7946)
Never: Forget to remove zero-area rings (area < 1e-10) — they cause world-spanning fills
Never: Use D3.js for the India map (too complex, was abandoned)
Never: Use Leaflet for the main India map (SSR issues, was abandoned)
```

### AI Anti-Patterns
```
Never: Call Anthropic or Gemini APIs directly — always use callAI() from ai-provider.ts
Never: Assume content[0] is the text block — use content.find(b => b.type === 'text')
Never: Set maxTokens < 2048 when using extended thinking
Never: Let ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL default to DB value — env var MUST take priority
Never: Hardcode "gemini" as the AI provider — read from AIProviderSettings in DB
```

### Database Anti-Patterns
```
Never: Store budget values in Crores — always store in Rupees, display ÷1e7
Never: Overwrite previous leadership records — ADD only, never delete historical leaders
Never: Add famous personality without verifying bornInDistrict = true for their district
       Example: Dr. Rajkumar was born in Erode, TN — NOT in Mandya (removed after error)
Never: Use `headline` field on NewsItem — the field is `title` (was a bug)
Never: Assume ElectionResult is per-candidate — it's per-constituency (winnerName/winnerParty)
```

### Deployment Anti-Patterns
```
Never: Run `npx vercel --prod` directly (causes Vercel scope switching issues)
       Always: git push origin main → auto-deploy
Never: Commit with git user.email != jayanthmbj@gmail.com (Vercel rejects deployment)
Never: Use `git commit --amend` after a failed pre-commit hook (amends PREVIOUS commit)
       Always: Fix the issue, re-stage, create a NEW commit
Never: Use `npm ci` in Dockerfile.scraper (peer dep conflicts — use npm install --legacy-peer-deps)
```

### Code Pattern Anti-Patterns
```
Never: recharts Tooltip formatter typed as (v: number) → TypeScript error
       Always: (v) + Number(v) cast
Never: Set overflow:hidden on the nav element (clips dropdown menus)
       Always: overflow:visible on Header nav
Never: Hardcode district or state names in API routes (use dynamic DB queries)
Never: Put secrets in NEXT_PUBLIC_ vars except NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL and NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID
Never: Accept CRON_SECRET as a URL query param (leaks in server logs/browser history)
       Always: read from Authorization: Bearer header only
Never: Use unbounded findMany() on high-cardinality tables (schools, elections)
       Always: add take: N (schools take:200, elections take:100)
```
